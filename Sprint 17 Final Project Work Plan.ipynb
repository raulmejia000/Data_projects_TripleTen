    "    \n",
    "    2. Are there any columns that should be excluded from modeling due to potential data leakage (e.g., features that wouldn’t be known at prediction time)?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Should I focus strictly on AUC-ROC optimization, or should I also balance it with Accuracy for a more practical model?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    4. Are there any limitations on creating new features from the provided columns, such as total services used or contract length in months?\n",

    "    5. Is there a preferred train/test split ratio, or should I use the standard 80/20 split?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    6. Should I perform class balancing techniques like oversampling/undersampling, or rely on model adjustments for imbalance?"

    "Handle missing values, check for duplicates, and fix data types (e.g., dates, categories). Convert EndDate into a binary churn variable for modeling.\n",

    "Step 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "Examine churn distribution, feature distributions, and relationships between variables. Use plots and summary stats to identify trends and patterns that may influence churn.\n",

    "Step 5 – Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "Split the dataset into training and test sets. Train multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and compare their AUC-ROC scores. Tune hyperparameters for the best model, and evaluate on the test set to aim for AUC-ROC ≥ 0.88."
