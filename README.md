This repository contains every project I completed during my TripleTen Data Science Bootcamp. Each project reflects a key stage of the program, covering topics such as data analysis, visualization, machine learning, time series forecasting, natural language processing, and more.

I successfully finished the course, and this collection serves as a complete archive of my hands-on work. Together, these projects demonstrate my ability to apply data science tools and techniques to real-world problems, from exploratory analysis to building and evaluating predictive models.
